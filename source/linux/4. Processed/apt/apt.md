# apt
#### `APT`
apt is a commandline package manager and provides commands for searching and managing as well as querying information about packages.


## Synopsis
```console
apt [options] command
```

## Commands
- <kbd>update</kbd> - update is used to resynchronize the package index files from their sources. The indexes of available packages are fetched from the location(s) specified in `/etc/apt/sources.list`. For example, when using a `Debian` archive, this command retrieves and scans the `Packages.gz` files, so that information about new and updated packages is available. An update should always be performed before an `upgrade` or `dist-upgrade`. Please be aware that the overall progress meter will be incorrect as the size of the package files cannot be known in advance

- `full-upgrade` - full-upgrade performs the function of upgrade but will remove currently installed packages if this is needed to upgrade the system as a whole


## Examples
